Kali Linux was founded upon the belief that to arrive at the best defensive strategy requires testers to put themselves in the shoes of potential attackers. To make it easier and more accessible for security professionals to test the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies, Kali Linux provides an all-in-one solution, combining 300+ penetration testing and security auditing programs with a Linux operating system, including Nmap for port and vulnerability scanning, Aircrack-ng for testing the security of wireless networks, Wireshark for monitoring network traffic, and Metasploit for network penetration testing. Like its predecessor BackTrack Linux, Kali Linux is completely free and always will be thanks to the support of Offensive Security.
